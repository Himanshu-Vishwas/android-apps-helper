</head>
<body>
  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 25, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Patna Metro Live Info</strong> (the "App" or "Service") collects, uses, discloses, and protects information when you use the App. By using the App you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

  <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
  <p><strong>Patna Metro Live Info</strong> is independently developed and maintained by the developer and is <strong>not affiliated with or endorsed by any government agency</strong>.</p>

  <h2>Data We Collect</h2>

  <h3>1. Information You Provide Directly</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Contact information you choose to send (for example, when you email us for support).</li>
    <li>Any content you explicitly enter into the app (feedback or reports).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Automatically Collected Information</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Device information: device model, OS version, unique device identifiers, and app version.</li>
    <li>Usage information: app screens visited, feature usage, timestamps, crashes and diagnostics, and analytics events.</li>
    <li>Network information: IP address and connection type.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. Location Information</h3>
  <p>The App requests your precise location (GPS) only if you grant permission. Location is used to provide features such as selecting the nearest metro station. Location access is <strong>optional</strong> — you may decline permission and still use most app features. When you grant permission:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The App may use your current latitude and longitude to compute and show the nearest station.</li>
    <li>Location data is used only for the described functionality. It is not sold. We may store location results (for example, nearest station selection) or aggregated/anonymous location statistics to improve the service; if you need specific location data deleted, contact us (see Contact section).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. Notifications (Firebase Cloud Messaging)</h3>
  <p>We use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to send push notifications for important updates, alerts, or news. You can opt-out of notifications via your device settings or through in-app controls (if available). Notifications do not include personal content unless you provided it explicitly.</p>

  <h2>Why We Collect Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide, maintain and improve the App.</li>
    <li>To determine the nearest station using your location (when you permit).</li>
    <li>To send push notifications (when you opt-in) via Firebase Cloud Messaging.</li>
    <li>To display and measure ads served via Google AdMob.</li>
    <li>To troubleshoot problems, diagnose issues and analyze usage.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third Parties and Services</h2>
  <p>We rely on third-party service providers to operate the App. These may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Firebase</strong> (Google) — for backend services and Analytics.</li>
    <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> — to serve advertisements and analytics related to ad performance.</li>
    <li>Crash reporting and analytics providers.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These providers may collect or process certain data. We recommend you review their privacy policies for details. We do not sell personal data to third parties.</p>

  <h2>Permissions (Android)</h2>
  <p>The App requests the following Android permissions for proper functionality:</p>
  <pre>
&lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/&gt;
&lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/&gt;
&lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/&gt;
&lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/&gt;
  </pre>
  <p><strong>Why:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>INTERNET</strong> — to fetch data, news and to communicate with backend services.</li>
    <li><strong>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE</strong> — to detect network connectivity and behave gracefully when offline.</li>
    <li><strong>ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION / ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION</strong> — to provide nearest-station features and other location-aware helpers (only when you grant permission).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Advertising & Analytics</h2>
  <p>We use Google AdMob to show ads. AdMob may collect device identifiers and other data to personalize ads unless you opt out of personalized ads via your device or Google settings. We also use analytics (for example, Firebase Analytics) to understand usage patterns and improve the app. These analytics data are aggregated and do not identify you personally.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain usage and analytics data as necessary to provide the App and to comply with legal obligations. You may request deletion of your data — see the Contact section below.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We take commercially reasonable measures to protect data in our possession. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

  <h2>Your Choices & Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> You can deny or revoke location permission from your Android settings at any time.</li>
    <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> You can opt-out of push notifications through the device notification settings or in-app controls (if provided).</li>
    <li><strong>Delete / Access:</strong> To request access to data we hold about you or request deletion, contact us (see Contact section). We will respond within a reasonable period in accordance with applicable law.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>The App is intended for users aged 13 and above. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete it.</p>

  <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
  <p>The App may contain links to third-party websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those websites. Please review any third-party privacy policies before providing personal information.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. The "Last updated" date at the top will indicate when the policy was last revised. We recommend checking this page periodically.</p>
